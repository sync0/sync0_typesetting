* Description 
This repository contains all files used for typesetting. 

As, primarily, an academic writer, most of my documents are structured so
that typesetting them in LaTeX saves a lot of effort. Despite its power,
LaTeX, as a markup language, does a mediocre job at distinguishing between
content and markup. While this shortcoming is palliated by the use of
snippets, I have found that writing documents in Emacs' Org mode and
exporting them to LaTeX works best. 

Therefore, in summary, my workflow is as follows:

1. Write documents in Emacs' Org mode. 
2. Add the appropriate code lines to have org mode invoke the appropriate
   typesetting configuration files (all included in this repository),
   depending on the type of document I am working on (two-column article,
   one-column article, book, thesis, draft, etc.).
3. Export the org mode file into a pdf.
4. [Optional] If I am not completely satisfied with the resulting ~pdf~, I
   edit the produced ~tex~ file, and compile it with Emacs' Auctex (i.e.,
   Emacs' LaTeX mode).
 
Except in rare occasions, 

If you are just beginning with LaTeX, I would advice to spend the time 

The shortcomings   

I used Emacs' Org mode to plan, draft, and write the thesis. If the
source code interests you, visit the ~org~ files. 

Using the org exporter, I exported the ~org~ files into ~LaTeX~, and then into pdfs.

I used LaTeX's KOMA Script class ~scrbook~.
